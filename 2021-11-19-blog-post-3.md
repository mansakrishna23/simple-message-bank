title: Blog Post 3 - Creating a Simple Webapp Ft. Flask
---
In this blog post, I will outline how to create a simple message bank webapp that allows users to submit and view messages using Flask!

A web application, or webapp for short, is an application software that can run on a web server, not to be confused with computer programs that can be run locally on your device. These webapps can be accessed using a web browser and often perform specific functions or tasks over the internet. 

The webapp we will build should allow users to not only submit messages to the message bank, but also allow users to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the message bank! To do so, we will need to use a database to store and display messages that are submitted in the webapp. Other examples of webapps that might use databases include discussion forums or registeration websites! These examples are perhaps a little more complex than our simple mesasge bank, but the underlying function is the same.  

In addition to this super interesting functionality of our webapp, we will be using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to make our webapp more appealing to users! 

### Part 1: Enabling Submissions
The first step in creating our simple webapp is to create an `app.py` file in which we will import the `Flask` package, i.e., the micro web framework written in Python. Within this `app.py` file we will create an instance of the `Flask` class with the name of the webapp's module or package as an argument (as shown in the following lines of code). Note that we need this `__name__` argument so that `Flask` knows where to look for our template and static files. 

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
```
One we have written the above lines of code, we will then go on to create a `submit` template with three user interfaces: (1) A text box for submitting messages, (2) A text box for submitting user names or handles, and (3) A submit button! Our `submit` template is really a `submit.html` file that will define the layout and content of our submit page.

For simplicity, it is easier to create a `base` template, which defines the general layout of a page, and then have `submit.html` extend `base.html`. First we will create a new folder in the same directory as our `app.py` file and call it `templates`. Within this folder we will create a new file, `base.html`. Our boilerplate code for `base.html` is displayed below:

```html
<!doctype html>
<!-- This appears at the top of the browser window -->
<title>Blog Post 3</title>
<nav>
  <!-- Web page heading -->
  <h1>A Simple Message Bank</h1>
</nav>
<section class="content">
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock %}
  </header>
  {% block content %}
    <br>
  {% endblock %}
</section>
```

Now, we will navigate back to our `app.py` file and add a `route` decorator that tells `Flask` the url we want for navigating to our main page. Note that the template for our main page is stored in the `base` template (i.e., `base.html`). So, we will have to update the `app.py` file as follows: 

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
# creating an instance of the Flask class
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def main():
    return render_template("base.html")
```
Note that we have imported a new function, the `render_template` function. This function tells `Flask` to search within the `templates` folder and generate output from the `base.html` template file stored there. 

Even though our webapp is far from complete, it is always good practice to periodically make sure our webapp is working (this is an iterative process)! So, let's go ahead and run flask by executing the following commands in our terminal or command prompt (Remember to activate the appropriate conda environment and navigate to the directory in which you have stored your `app.py` file). 

```shell
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Your webapp should currently look something like this:

![flask-very-basic.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/flask-very-basic.png)

As we can see from the above image of our main page, this creates a very simple page with only our title "A Simple Message Bank". We will now iteratively add more functionalities to our webapp and keep checking our page on the browser to ensure everything is in order!

Let's add a couple more details to our `base.html` file. Suppose we want users to know what the webapp is for. We can do so by adding a small paragraph tag to our boilerplate code explaining what our webapp is supposed to do!

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Blog Post 3</title>
<nav>
  <h1>A Simple Message Bank</h1>
</nav>
<section class="content">
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock %}
  </header>
  {% block content %}
    <br>
    <!-- Add the following paragraph tag explaining what our webapp does  -->
    <p> Welcome to this simple message bank! Feel free to submit a message and view messages within the bank!</p>
  {% endblock %}
</section>
```
Our main page now looks like this: 

![flask-basic.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/flask-basic.png)

So, now that we have our `base` template and `app.py` files set up, we can finally create our `submit` template (i.e., `submit.html`) within our `templates` folder. Recall that we need to create our `submit` template such that it has three user interfaces:
- A text box for submitting a message.
- A text box for submitting the name or handle of the user. 
- A submit button. 
To do so, we will have `submit.html` `extend` `base.html` using jinja tags (jinja tags have the following syntax: `{% %}`). 

```html
<!--The Submit Message Page Extended from base.html-->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Submit{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <!-- <p> Creating the three user interfaces </p> -->
    <br>
    <form method="post">
      <!-- Creating a text box for submitting a message -->
      <label for="message">Your message:</label>
      <input type="text" name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      <!-- Creating a text box for submitting name or handle -->
      <label for="handle">Your name or handle:</label>
      <input type="text" name="handle" id="handle">
      <br>
      <!-- Creating a submit button -->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit message">
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

Suppose after a user submits a message, we would like our webapp to return a thank you message. Let's go ahead and add that to our `submit` template (after the form tag)!

```html
{% if thanks %}
  <b>Thank you for submitting a message!</b>
{% endif %}
```
Now that our `submit` template is complete, let's go ahead and update our `app.py` and `base.html` files. For `app.py`, we now need to add another route decorator that tells `Flask` to render the `submit` template when navigating to the `/submit/` url. So, we add the following lines of code to our `app.py` file!

```python
@app.route("/submit/", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else:
        return render_template("submit.html", thanks=True)
```

Notice in the above block of code, we have defined two methods `POST` and `GET`. These methods are used for sending data to and from a web server. The `GET` method is usually the most common method and is used to retrieve data from a specified web server. The `POST` method is used to send data to a web server. 

In this case, the `GET` method retrieves information from the web server and renders the `submit` template. The `POST` method, on the other hand, currently renders the `submit` template after having received information from the user without performing any other task. Additionally, the `thanks` variable (which we had used earlier in our `submit` template) is set to `True` so that our webapp will return a thanks statement to the user after they submit a message. 

Now that we've updated our `app.py` file, we can update our `base` template! We need to add in a link that allows users to navigate to our submit page, so we simply add in the following line of code:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Blog Post 3</title>
<nav>
  <h1>A Simple Message Bank</h1>
  <ul>
    <!-- Adds link to submit page on main page -->
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">Submit a Message</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<section class="content">
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock %}
  </header>
  {% block content %}
    <br>
    <p> Welcome to this simple message bank! Feel free to submit a message and view messages within the bank!</p>
  {% endblock %}
</section>
```
Once again, it's good practice to check our web browser to make sure our webapp looks alright. Let's go ahead and run it!





{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
As far as this particular project was concerned, undoubtedly the most tedious part was writing the webscraper and identifying the correct HTML/CSS code that would allow us to extract the appropriate data! For this, found it particularly helpful to navigate through the websites in advance (manually) and explore the developer code beforehand. A lesson learned was to scrape only the required data; in order words I had to identify the information I needed and plan how I was going to store it in advance - it would have been really inefficient if I were to simply scrape the entire site! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
